      <h2>Definitions</h2>
      <dl class="definition-list">
        <dt>“Recovero”</dt>
        <dd>The introducer/lead-generation service that connects customers with independent recovery/transport operators.</dd>
        <dt>“Customer”</dt>
        <dd>The person requesting recovery or transport assistance.</dd>

    </section>

    <section class="content-card">
      <h2>Our Role</h2>
      <p>Recovero operates solely as an introducer. We connect Customers with independent Operators who provide the Service under a separate contract directly between the Customer and the Operator. Recovero is not the merchant of record for any recovery or transport work.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-card">
      <h2>Quotes &amp; Website Pricing</h2>
      <p>Any prices shown on the Recovero website are typical, indicative examples only and do not constitute a binding quote. Actual pricing may vary based on factors such as distance, vehicle condition, access constraints, time of day, location, and any special handling required. The Operator will confirm the price with the Customer before dispatch wherever possible.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-card">
      <h2>Payments</h2>
      <p>All payments for the Service are made directly to the Operator. Recovero may receive a referral or marketing fee from the Operator, but does not process payments for the recovery or transport Service itself.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-card">
      <h2>Call-Out &amp; Attendance Fees</h2>
      <p>Call-out fees and any other charges are set by each Operator. Operators may apply call-out or attendance fees where, for example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A cancellation occurs after the Operator has been dispatched.</li>
        <li>The Operator cannot gain safe access to the vehicle or Customer.</li>
        <li>Site conditions are unsafe or unsuitable to complete the job.</li>
        <li>Details supplied are inaccurate or incomplete.</li>
        <li>The vehicle differs materially from the description provided.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="content-card">
      <h2>Cancellations &amp; No-Shows</h2>
      <p>To cancel, contact Recovero or the Operator using the details provided at the time of booking. Late cancellations or no-shows after dispatch may incur Operator charges, including call-out or attendance fees.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-card">
      <h2>Refunds</h2>
      <p>Any refunds are handled directly by the Operator in line with their policies. Recovero can assist with routing refund requests to the appropriate Operator but does not control or process refunds.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-card">
      <h2>Liability &amp; Complaints</h2>
      <p>The Operator is solely responsible for performing the Service. Recovero is not liable for the Operator’s performance, timing, or any loss or damage arising from the Service. We will, however, help connect Customers with Operators and assist in escalating concerns where possible.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-card">
      <h2>Customer Responsibilities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide accurate and complete information about the vehicle, location, access, and condition.</li>
        <li>Ensure safe access for the Operator and vehicle, including providing keys or immobiliser access where needed.</li>
        <li>Advise of any hazards, modified vehicles, or unusual conditions that may affect recovery or transport.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="content-card">
      <h2>Availability</h2>
      <p>Recovero aims to offer introductions 24/7, but availability is not guaranteed and depends on Operator capacity, weather, major incidents, and geographic coverage.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-card">
      <h2>Governing Law</h2>
